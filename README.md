## Fake News Detection Using NLP

# Overview

This project focuses on utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect fake news articles. The objective is to build a deep learning model that can classify news articles as either "real" or "fake" based on their content and linguistic features.

# Project Description

Fake news has become a growing concern in today's digital age. This project aims to tackle the issue by implementing NLP techniques to build a deep learning model for fake news detection. The process involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, model development, and evaluation.

# Dataset

For this project, we use a publicly available dataset of labeled news articles. The dataset is split into two classes: "real" and "fake" news articles. You can obtain the dataset from â€¯https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset

# Preprocessing

Text Cleaning:  special characters.
Tokenization: Split the text into individual words or tokens.
Stopword Removal: Eliminate common stopwords to reduce noise.


# Feature Extraction

To transform the text data into numerical features, we use encoding technique.

# Model Development

We experiment with deep learning algorithms, such as:

Deep Learning : Bidirectional RNN,LSTM

# Evaluation

To assess the model's performance, we use metrics such as:
Accuracy
Confusion Matrix

# Usage

Install the required dependencies (see the Dependencies section).
Preprocess your data, extract features, and use the trained model for prediction.
Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy.

# Dependencies

Python 3.x
Libraries:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
NLTK
TensorFlow (for deep learning models)
wordcloud, re, stopwords
